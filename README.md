# Google-Hashcode-2020
First attempt at a hackathon: Google Hashcode 2020.

We optimized maximum score per library per day, which scored the maximum possible score for some datasets but 
performed poorly on others. A better approach would have been to optimize the maximum number of libraries that
could be completed to begin scanning.
